| col 3 is      | right-aligned |            $1 |

## Lists

Here is an **unordered list**:

- Some unordered lists with some really long text about random things just to fill it up really well and to see how overflow looks like and with more content to fill than is ever truly needed
  - Second level
    - Third level
    - Third level
  - Second level
- Another one?
  - what
  - [ ] checkbox
  - [ ] another

An **ordered list**:

1. Some unordered lists
   1. Second level
      1. Third level
      2. Third level
   2. Second level
2. Another first level

And a **mixed one**:

      1. Third level
      2. Third level
   - Another second level

## Code Section

This is an `inline code`.

And then a JavaScript code block:

```js
function sayHello(toWho) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${toWho}!`);
}
sayHello("Nuxt";)
```

And a Java code block:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Nuxt!");
    }
}
```
